Aiming for 50%, but may be lower depending on future earnings.

Preliminary career plans are to work in quantitative finance (I'm interning at Jane Street Capital this summer.) If I go down this path, I intend to donate a considerably higher percentage.

I'm going to explore alternative career paths in my next couple of years at university, however. If I go into a career with much lower earnings (e.g. research) then the percentage might fall accordingly (e.g. to 10%.) But if I were to do this, it would be because I felt the direct impact of the career outweighed any loss of donation potential.","Earning to Give","21","Male","Yes","United Kingdom","Cambridge","Atheist, agnostic or non-religious",66.28,0,"159","2015-11-04 05:39:38","9","en","2015-11-04 05:29:21","2015-11-04 05:39:38","http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/index.php/237851/lang-en?source=fbsample","Yes","Yes",NA,"This cause is near the top priority","This cause deserves significant investment but less than the top priorities","This cause deserves significant investment but less than the top priorities","This cause deserves significant investment but less than the top priorities","This cause is near the top priority","This cause is near the top priority","This cause is near the top priority","This cause is the top priority",NA,"Vegetarian","GiveWell","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No",NA,NA,"22","Male","Yes","United Kingdom","Cambridge (UK)","Atheist, agnostic or non-religious","79.04",16452.5
